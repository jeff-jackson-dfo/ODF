# ODF Toolbox

## History and Background

For more almost 40 years, employees at the [Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO)](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/index-eng.htm) Canada created and have used the in-house Ocean Data Format (ODF) to encapsulate oceanographic data.

This in-house file format was created at [BIO (Bedford Institute of Oceanography)](https://www.bio.gc.ca/index-en.php) and over the years toolboxes for working with oceanographic 
data stored in this format have been created and used. It should be noted that important contributions to the ODF format and toolbox code base have been made by colleagues at 
[IML (Institut Maurice-Lamontagne)](https://www.qc.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/en/maurice-lamontagne-institute). 

For more than 20 years now, the in-house ODF toolbox was developed and has been maintained using the commercial scientific development environment named [MATLAB<sup>&reg;</sup>](https://www.mathworks.com/).
While this environment served many purposes, the increasing costs and growing restricitions of commercial software such as MATLAB<sup>&reg;</sup> have forced some data groups to 
assess open source alternatives.

A few years ago the data group at BIO decided to start all new script development using the [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) language within [RStudio<sup>&reg;</sup>](https://rstudio.com/) and the [Python](https://www.python.org/) language, primarily using the [Anaconda<sup>&copy;</sup>](https://www.anaconda.com/) development ecosystem. 
Both of these open source languages have taken off and more and more scientific work has migrated to these type of open source development environments.

## Current Development

This codebase, although primarily used by DFO employees, may be useful for those wishing to utilize the oceanographic data stored in ODF files.
